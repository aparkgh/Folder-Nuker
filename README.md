# Folder-Nuker
**Folder Nuker** is a simple and fast folder generator, written in Windows Batch, that creates empty folders very quickly.

## Directions of use
* Place `nuke.bat` in the directory where you want to create folders and run the file.
* Press any key as prompted to begin folder creation.
* Close the Command Prompt window to stop the process once you're done.

**Warning:** This script generates folders very quickly and will continue to do so until the Command Prompt window is manually closed. Be cautious and ensure it's run in the correct directory to avoid unintended folder creation.
